Hey there! :cowboy_hat_face: I'm Martin, I'm a Data Engineer at Cooke Aquaculture. I provide the organization with clean data for operational and analytical reporting. I do a little bit of everything - from grabbing data from APIs and building data pipelines to writing tons of SQL, cleaning data, creating data models, and sometimes making business intelligence reports. My go-to tools are currently Snowflake and Python, but I also know my way around technologies like SQL Server, Git, Bash, Powershell, Docker, Boomi, Azure, Markdown, Power BI, and Excel.

When I'm not working, I'm usually mountain biking, DIY-ing around the house, or hanging out with my daughter. I also enjoy video games, board games, skiing, and learning every day.
