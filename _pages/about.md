Howdy! :cowboy_hat_face: I’m Martin, I'm a Data Engineer at Cooke Aquaculture. 
I provide the organization with clean data for operational 
and analytical reporting. I play a role in everything that entails - 
getting the data from APIs, building and maintaining data pipelines, 
writing tons of SQL, cleaning data, creating data models, and occasionally, 
developing business intelligence reports. My favourite tools these days 
are Snowflake and Python.

My technical skills include SQL (Snowflake, SQL Server), Python, Git, Bash, 
Docker, Boomi, Azure, Markdown, Power BI and Excel.

In my free time I’m an avid mountain biker, DIYer and new dad. 
I also enjoy video games, board games, hanging out with my daughter, 
skiing and learning every day.
