Howdy! :cowboy_hat_face: I'm Martin, I'm a Data Engineer at Cooke Aquaculture. I provide the organization with clean data for operational and analytical reporting. I do a little bit of everything - getting data from APIs, building data pipelines, writing tons of SQL, cleaning data, creating data models, and occasionally, developing business intelligence reports. My go-to tools are currently Snowflake and Python, but I'm also skilled in SQL Server, Git, Bash, Powershell, Docker, Boomi, Azure, Java (Groovy), Markdown, Power BI, SQL Server Reporting Services, and Excel.

When I'm not working, I'm usually mountain biking, working on a DIY project, or hanging out with my daughter. I also enjoy video games, board games, skiing, and learning every day.
